***Live-Slideshow is no Slideshow.***


Tiny script which displays a slideshow to an audience.
The script is intended to recognize new images and then 
show the new images first, before the remaining slideshow
continues in random order.

This project is for now intended to be used once on a wedding
event and there are no plans for it to be extended.
